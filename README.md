# Advent of Code - 2025

This repo contains code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) 2025 challenge.

Days 1 and 2 can be found in the `lua` directory. After those 2 days, I decided I had learned enough Lua and did not want to continue writing in it for the remaining days, so I switched to Rust (see `rust` directory).
